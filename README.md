Title: Final Project

Description: An iPhone app designed to help people know what fun activities/events are happening around them. Uses a photo based sharing network integrated with GPS to show exciting photos near the user.

Vision Statement: 

Motivation: To help familiarize us with swift, databases, and web/server based integration. Also, to provide an easy way to share exciting/interesting things around you.

Risks: Not well experienced with server based programming and swift -- but ready to learn.

Strategy for Risk: Split the work up so every memeber just has to worry about one particular element, and then as a team we can put it all back toegether.

Requirements: 

Methodology: Agile

Project Tracking Software: Pivotal Tracker

Project Plan:


To Get Running:
1) Download MAMP
2) Download/Open Xcode
3) Double click on the .xcodeproj
4) Try running the project that was opened, if there are build errors:
	Select file -> new project -> IOS -> Application -> Single View
	With that open, delete the AppDelegate.swift, ViewController.swift, and Main.storyboard. Right click
	on the project, select add files, and add the files you just deleted from the github repo.

MAMP:
With mamp downloaded, start it up and start up the MySQL server. Copy and paste the 'test.php' file into the
mamp folder that MAMP should have created.
